This is a preliminary repository for providing Democles interpreter libraries via Maven.

### How to use it

Use the following snippet in your *pom.xml*:
```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>democles-mvn-releases</id>
        <url>https://github.com/eMoflon/democles-mvn-repo/master/releases</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Currently, there is no *snapshots* Maven repository in this Git repository.
